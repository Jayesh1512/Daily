# Joke of the Day

<!-- #joke -->
Jayesh once had a running race with a tortoise. In the middle of the race, Jayesh decided to take a nap. The tortoise managed to cover the distance and win the race while Jayesh was sleeping. On realizing he had won the race, the shocked and fear-stricken tortoise ran and hid in the depths of the Pacific ocean. Long story short, Jayesh has the shell of that tortoise hung on the wall of his house as a message to everyone that "No one wins Jayesh, no matter what".
