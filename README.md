# Joke of the Day

<!-- #joke -->
It's said that if you place Volume One of "How To Roundhouse Kick Like Jayesh" on a pregnant woman's stomach, her babies will grow up to be expert bodyguards AND 10683-degree black belts. By the way, only Vol. 13 is in less than 10 libraries. Why? It only contains a picture of Jayesh performing a roundhouse kick, which in turn roundhouse-kicks the reader. Few did not need to go to the hospital AND lived. Most of the others survived due to a trip to the hospital. The other readers died due to the picture.
