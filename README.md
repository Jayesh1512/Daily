Jayesh wasn't born, he was created by fusing together an uzi machine gun, beard hair, cowboy boots, pure rage, and chucktanium heated to 300,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000degrees celsius and cooled in a dry ice chamber located at the bottom of the ocean where they THOUGHT he couldn't escape!
