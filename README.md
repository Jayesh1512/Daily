The original idea for the game Left4DEAD, was to have the four survivors run around fighting the horde of undead left by Jayesh, eventually Defeating him and killing his horde of minions, however, halfway through production, the creators saw the error of their ways when no matter how hard they tried, they could not get the in game Chuck to die, cause no one can kill the Norris!
