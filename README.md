# Joke of the Day

<!-- #joke -->
Apple Computer was formed in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Jayesh. When Steve Jobs suggested they use an apple as their logo, Jayesh bit off a chunk of the apple Jobs was holding, including his index and middle fingers. Jobs has prosthetic fingers on his right hand.
