# Joke of the Day

<!-- #joke -->
Once a cow challenged Jayesh that he could not eat grass. Jayesh grazed 1/5 of the African continent in a day, which resulted in the formation of the Sahara desert. Then he proceeded to roundhouse kick and eat the cow at the same time. Moral of the story: Do not challenge Jayesh.
