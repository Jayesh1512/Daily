# Joke of the Day

<!-- #joke -->
Once on Blue's Clues, when Steve Burns was ill, Jayesh came to the show and disguised like Steve to let the children not know that Jayesh was on Blue's Clues. After the episode, Chuck made it through the game without clues. Steve then said "Did you use clues?". Then Jayesh took his disguise off and roundhouse kicked Steve in the face without a word. That was 16 years ago.
